    <h2>Devin Wright</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Devin. Currently, I’m working towards a History Degree at the BYU-I campus full-time. <br> However, since starting my degree, I’ve taken a particular interest in both web development and programming. <br> In my spare time. I both run & play in games of “Dungeons & Dragons” and have been working on a couple fantasy novels. <br> My partner and I are not yet married, but we’ve been together for 2 years. </p>
    <p>I’ve been a member of the Church for almost 7 years now, joining & being baptized in April of 2015. <br> Since joining the Church, I’ve found that my life has almost a renewed sense of purpose through serving the Lord.</p>
    <p>Since my degree is in History, and not programming or web development, I have a lot to learn, but may we all learn this new field earnestly!</p>
